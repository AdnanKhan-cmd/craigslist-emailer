### Gmail Settings:
If you use Gmail, in order to send emails using this script, you will need to set Gmail to allow sending email from less secure sources.
Gmail will send you an email with instructions once you run this script for the first time.

Alternatively, you can set it from here:
https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

### Run the Script:
Execute it:

```bash
$ node index.js
```
